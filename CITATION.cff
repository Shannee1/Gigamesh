    "The GigaMesh Software Framework is a modular software for display, editing and visualization of 3D-data
    typically acquired with structured light scanning (SLS) or structure from motion (SfM).
    It provides numerous functions for analysis of archaeological objects like cuneiform tablets, ceramics or converted LiDAR data.
    Typically applications are unwrappings (or rollouts), profile cuts (or cross sections) as well as visualizations of distances and curvature,
    which can be exported as raster graphics or vector graphics.
    The retrieval of text in 3D like damaged cuneiform tablets or weathered medieval headstones using Multi Scale Integral Invariant (MSII) filtering,
    which is a core function of the software. Furthermore small or faint surface details like fingerprints can be visualized.
    The polygonal meshes of the 3D-models can be inspected, cleaned and repaired to provide optimal filtering results.
    The repaired datasets are suitable for 3D printing and for digital publishing in a dataverse."
