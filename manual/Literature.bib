	registration based on forward search techniques and surface consistency,
	and a non-penetrating iterated closest point algorithm. We illustrate

  abstract = {Hundreds of thousands of ancient documents with cuneiform script are
	known to be in museum collections and are found on a daily basis
	at archaeological excavations. Analyzing these documents is essential
	to understand the origins of civilization, legislation and religion.
	This script is a handwriting and was used for several millennia in
	the ancient Middle East. Its name is derived from the Latin word
	for wedge, which is the 3D-shape left by an ancient scribe's stylus,
	when it was pressed into the soft surface of a clay tablet. Manually
	drawing and transcribing these tablets is a laborious and tedious
	task and assistance by an automated and computerized system is highly
	demanded. 
	
	
	The aim of this thesis is extracting these handwritten characters,
	i.e. 3D-shapes with high variability. The crucial steps for feature
	extraction from 2D-manifolds in 3D-space are reliable edge detection
	and segmentation. This can be achieved using integral invariant filtering,
	a robust technique known from signal processing and shape matching
	in 2D-space. In 3D-space the state-of-the-art systems roughly estimate
	integral invariants for determining small numbers of highly distinctive
	features to solve puzzles of fractured objects.
	
	
	In order to precisely determine 3D-shapes of characters the pipeline
	known from image processing and pattern recognition is adapted for
	3D-models. These models have millions of vertices, which are acquired
	by optical 3D-scanners. The vertices approximate manifolds with an
	irregular triangular mesh. Different types of integral invariant
	filtering in multiple scales lead to different high-dimensional feature
	spaces. Convolutions and combined metrics are applied to the feature
	spaces to determine connected components i.e. characters with sub-triangle
	accuracy within a manifold. Concurrently with the design of novel
	algorithms, the properties of the integral invariants are investigated.
	Understanding these properties is highly relevant for robust curvature
	measures and segmentation. The extraction of characters is completed
	with a Voronoi inspired method resulting in a minimal meaningful
	vector representation. This representation is an important basis
	for paleography. Further abstraction and normalization lead to character
	recognition. The embedment of the proposed methods in the novel and
	layered GigaMesh software framework enables a wide variety of applications.
	Memory efficiency and parallel processing were taken into account
	in the design of the configurable mesh processing pipeline. The pipeline
	has only one relevant parameter, which is the maximum size of the
	expected features. 
	
	
	The proposed methods were tested on hundreds of cuneiform tablets
	as well as on other objects including synthetic datasets. Representative
	results are shown and an evaluation regarding accuracy and performance
	of the algorithms are given. Finally observations about integral
	invariants in higher dimensions are shown and an outlook is given.},

  abstract = {Differential invariants of curves and surfaces such as curvatures
	and their derivatives play a central role in Geometry Processing.
	They are, however, sensitive to noise and minor perturbations and
	do not exhibit the desired multi-scale behavior. Recently, the relationships
	between differential invariants and certain integrals over small
	neighborhoods have been used to define efficiently computable integral
	invariants which have both a geometric meaning and useful stability
	properties. This paper considers integral invariants defined via
	distance functions, and the stability analysis of integral invariants
	in general. Such invariants proved useful for many tasks where the
	computation of shape characteristics is important. A prominent and
	recent example is the automatic reassembling of broken objects based
	on correspondences between fracture surfaces.},
