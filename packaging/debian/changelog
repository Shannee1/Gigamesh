  * +) Screenshot views: new export to PDF (requiring pdflatex). Currently only using horizontal axis and only six views. See 'File - Export Screenshots - Screenshot Views (PDF+PNG)'.
    +) Screenshot views: PDF export can be applied to a whole directory with multiple meshes (not recursive). See 'File - Export Screenshots - Screenshot Views Directory (PDF+PNG)'.
    +) Screenshot views: default is now six views - eight views are optional for e.g. cuneiform tablets. See 'File - Export Screenshots - Views Six (...)'.
    +) Roll mesh (or plane) clockwise by a half degree using the 'r' key.
    +) Improved keyboard layout display. See 'Info - Keyboard Layout' menu.
    +) Zoom with plus and minus keys enabled. Holding shift increases the zoom factor. Only tested with German keyboards!
    +) Split mesh using the plane with and without dialog. For the latter see  'Edit - Split by plane (Quick)'.
    +) Split mesh using the plane: option seperate checked by default. See 'Edit - Split by plane (Advanced)'.
    +) Meta-Data: Entry web-reference added. All three entries can be edited. See 'Info - Meta-Data Edit: ...'.
    +) CLI gigamesh-featurevectors automatically selects the number of threads using the number of CPU cores minus one.
    +) CLI gigamesh-info is NEW for collecting information about meshes. See '-h' or '--help' for options.
    +) CLI gigamesh-clean optimized. Cleaning meshes is now 3-5x faster.
    +) CLI gigamesh-clean allows to (pre)set the embedded Meta-data with options '--set-material-when-empty' and '--set-id-when-empty'. See 'gigamesh-clean --help'.
    +) CLI gigamesh-clean writes meta information about the process to <filename-out>.info-clean.txt.
    o) CLI gigamesh-clean skips files already processed. So it can easily be used to re-start the cleaning in case of an external error i.e. no disk space.
    o) CLI gigamesh-clean writes new files and meta-data sidecar into the current directory and not into the directory of the input files are i.e. sort of an implicit copy.
    +) Bugfix: Transparent colors are set to opaque for backfaces as transparency is not supported.
    +) Bugfix: Function distance to center of gravity of a selected primitive was doing nothing.
    +) Bugfix: Screenshots of perspective renderings caused a crash.
    +) Bugfix: recent files had wrong extensions in case of upper case file names.
    +) Bugfix: gigamesh-clean had a memory leaking causing it to be killed after processing large numbers of files (hundreds).

gigamesh (181004-1) stable; urgency=low
  * +) Major bugfix: the MSII filter results were randomly influenced. MSII results were affected since version 180329.
    +) Multiplication of the function value to the color per vertex. See 'Edit' and usefull together with the normalization.
    +) Function value normalization using Colorramp settings.
    +) Removal of vertices on edges connecting faces with improper i.e. inverted orientation. Cleaning is now faster, more robust and results in a nicer mesh.
    +) Removal of 'dangling' faces along borders. See 'Remove - Faces Border Erosion' as well as clean mesh and automatic polishing.
    +) Select 'dangling' faces i.e. having three border vertices. See 'Select - Faces - having 3 Border Vertices'.
    +) gigamesh-clean removes 'dangling' faces by default. This can be turned off using the option -n or --no-border-erosion.
    +) For the number of 'dangling' faces and vertices on inverted edges see 'Info - Mesh information'.
    +) File save as button after orientation including suggested file suffix 'GMO'.
    +) Minor improvement for entering Meta-Data e.g. Model Id and material.

  * +) Multiple polylines from isolines using the function values. See 'Analyze - Polylines from multiple FunctionValues'. Very usefull after computing 'Functions - Distance to Plane'.
    +) Multi-selections like function values for isolines accept ranges denoted with one or two colons. E.g. 1:3 is equal to enter '1 2 3' or 1:-0.5:0 is equal to '1.0 0.5 0.0'.
    +) Store function value rendering (colors) as color per vertex. See 'Edit - Transform function values to RGB'.
    +) Export of PNGs have the correct resolution in DPI embedded. The DPI value can be appended to the filename optionally with 'File - Export Screenshots - DPI Suffix for ortho images'. The 'setdpi' script is now obsolete.

    +) Usage for gigamesh-clean added use -h or --help.
    +) Sphere rollout adapted to user interaction similiar to cone rollout i.e. ask to flip the mesh and show profile lines.
